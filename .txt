15.Images and links
Good work! Let's make sure you really understand images and links before we move on to the review.

Instructions
Between the <body> tags, add two images using the <img> tag. One should be a link; the other should not. The link can go anywhere you want.
After your two images, create a link that's just a line of text. It can link anywhere you want.
